This package has a set of configuration files for the Bash (sh) shell.
It makes heavy use of the nice usability features of Bash.

To use it, you need to be running the Bash shell.
Check your appropriate line in /etc/passwd to see if you run Bash.
If not, you may be able to use "chsh" to change your shell to "/bin/bash".

There is a Makefile in the project directory. Type “make” to view 
the installation options.

  % make 		display this help

  % make backup		take a backup of the original .bashrc
                        (it is saved as .bashrc.ORIGINAL)
                        you should run this once in the begining
                        otherwise you may overwrite the backup

  % make install	install the new .bashrc* files in
                        the current directory

  % make systeminstall	install the new .bashrc* files in
                        /usr/local/share/bashrc, then add
                        bashrc_config to /usr/local/bin/

Now read the FAQ file on the new functionality and how to use it properly.

This project is based on bashrc, http://www.github.com/simos/bashrc/
Some things may not appear complete; bear with us while we port the functionality.

WE DID NOT PORT ALL THE CONFIGURATION FILES TO BASHRC. 
There is work to be done, however the files should be usable in the current state.
